## INTRODUCTION
I decided to create a fictitious kiddies club located in Rotterdam, Netherlands. A kiddies club encouraging learning, socializing and playing. In the website, I Showcased some activities we had recently.
In the website, there is a landing page and three additional pages to create a simple and attractive website for Kids. This project is to showcase efficiency in HTML and CSS website. I hope to create a front end application,
which can be used easily by users.
